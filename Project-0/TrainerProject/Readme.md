# **TITLE: TUTOR APP** 
## **EXPLANATION:**
This is my tutor app. This project helps in connecting the user with the trainer. Pursope of this project is Displaying various trainers with various skills various experience and various education qualification. You can search a Trainer or you become a Trainer.  I have developed the application for this purpose. This application has a seperate option for a Trainer and a general user can view the user details of trainers. If you're a trainer it has options like signup for new trainer and login for existing user. In signup it asks for trainer General details (like firstname, lastname, age etc.), Education details, Skills that Trainer have and Work details. If Trainer choose login they can view their profile, edit their profile, delete any particular field or delete their entire profile.
